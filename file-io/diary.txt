Hi this is Sattwik Sahu. It is the 5th of July 2022, I am in the library
at IISER Bhopal. Probably the last place I make long lasting friendships -
or that's what our CHM 112 professor, Vishal Rai says. Having a great time
here, but we have our endsems coming up and the 1st year is going to end soon.
It has ended too soon. The first year was actually less than 7 months long and
I don't understand how they call it a "year". This could have gone on longer.
We could have done so much more, created so many more memories, created so many
more stronger bonds.. But here we are, on the threshold of the 2nd year. Will everything
still be as excitig? I hope...

Just another test entry in the diary...

Here's another one
